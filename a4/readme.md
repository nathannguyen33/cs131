The one issue I tried to fix with movies.csv was cleaning up the movies column. There were a lot of entries that differed with some of the years not even having an end. I aim to make this column into two different entries with a start year and an end year.

I will run three different scripts to accomplish this. The first script will turn the singular column into two different entries START and END. The second script will remove all (. The third script will replace all ) with an empty space to separate entries.
